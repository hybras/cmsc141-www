# Project 2: TBD Game

## Overview
You will be creating a maze game. The user will navigate an pirate around the maze using key presses and mouse clicks. The maze will contain some obstacles, as well as special items (gadgets), such as meat to completely restore the pirate’s strength, lemons to give them a small strength boost, wet floor signs to deplete their strength, or explosives to allow the pirate to remove an obstacle. The strength is shown as the yellow bar on the right. The goal: help the pirate safely make it back to the treasure chest at the end of the maze.

Specifically, you will make a) the code to “render” (draw) the maze, its items, and the pirate, and b) the logic required to allow the (human) player to use the mouse and keyboard to navigate the pirate around the maze.

To configure the maze, we will use tables in a new way: you’ll use a Google Sheet to set up where the walls should be, as well as additional Google Sheets to give the coordinates where gadgets should initially be. Your program will read in these sheets, using them to create the actual background image and initial game state. The game play itself will be implemented with a reactor (as we did in lab 2 and have been doing in lecture).

## Learning Goals
This project applies what we’ve been learning about lists, recursion, and datatypes. It exercises your ability to detect what information does and doesn’t change over time in a program. It has the side benefit of showing you how animations can be built, and of showing how tables can be useful for more than just storing data. Here are the specific skills you will practice.
- Creating and using your own datatypes.
- Using recursion to process various types of lists.
- Breaking down complex goals into discrete, solvable tasks.
- Using tables for code configuration rather than as datasets.

## Game Details
### Maze
The entire maze should be surrounded by one layer of walls (except at the end location), so you don’t have to deal with the pirate moving outside of the maze. This also makes it clear to the human player where they need to navigate to in order to complete the game.

The wall and floor tiles are 30x30 pixels (you will need this information to convert coordinates in the grid to coordinates for place-image in Pyret). The pirate, gadgets, and obstacles are 24x24 pixels.

### The Player and Character
The current position of the player in the maze is represented with an image of the pirate. The human player moves the pirate using the `W` (up), `A` (left), `S` (down), and `D` (right) keys. The pirate cannot walk through obstacles or walls of the maze, but can move through empty space.

### Gadgets and Obstacles
There are two kinds of items placed in the demo maze: gadgets and obstacles. Gadgets are things a player can pick up. Obstacles block the pirate's movement until they are removed using the explosives gadget.

There can be an arbitrary number of these items placed on the maze. Items are picked up when the player moves into their cells (meaning they disappear subsequently); stamina-increasing gadgets are immediately consumed, and explosives are “held on to” until use. Multiple explosives can be collected; only one is used each time the player removes an obstacle.

You will implement either stamina gadgets or explosives/obstacles into the game. <b>You only need to implement one of these to get full credit.</b> You may do both if you want, but you will not get extra credit. Either option is challenging in its own way; we do not think either is significantly easier than the other.

### Starting, Winning, and Losing
The pirate will start at a location of your choosing. The information of where they start should be hardcoded through named constants in your code.

The player wins the game upon reaching the treasure chest at an exit location that you set. This information should also be hardcoded through constants.

The player loses the game if the pirate runs out of stamina. If you don’t implement stamina gadgets, the player doesn’t have to worry about losing.

Upon winning or losing, the game can simply stop. You may also choose to somehow inform the player that they have won or lost, but this is not required.
